## What is Quiqr?

> Quiqr is a hackable, open source, cross platform, Hugo specialized, offline desktop CMS application with build in Git functionality for deploying static sites to any hosting server.

With Quiqr you can **build,** **share**, **maintain** and publish **websites.**

Quiqr is a fork of [Hokus CMS](https://www.hokuscms.com/). Without this brilliant work we couldn't be where we are.
